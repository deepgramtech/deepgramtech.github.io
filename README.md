# DeepGram 

With this project we want to develop a Telegram bot to allow you running Machine Learning and Deep Learning experiments directly on your phone. 

The only requirement will be the [Telegram app](https://telegram.org/apps) (or third party alternatives) installed on your phone/laptop, or just a browser to run [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org/).

## Why is important?

_Has it ever happened to you to have an idea that you would like to prototype faster?_ I know that is wrong to answer with a question to a question. But what we want is to allow you to implement some Machine Learning algorithm very fast, _on-the-fly_.

You won't need to go home, turn your computer on, open your IDE, copy some model from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), becoming mad installing packages till you give up your awesome idea and go back to your 9-5 job.

You just need to open your Telegram app and click the right buttons.

## This is a community based project.

No leaders here. Just passionate people desiring to learn, and _to create_. We organize **MeetUps** to make this real. If you are around Genova (Italy), come and build with us.

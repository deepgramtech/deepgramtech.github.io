# DeepGram 

With this project we want to develop a Telegram bot to allow you running Machine Learning and Deep Learning experiments directly on your phone. 

The only requirement will be the [Telegram app](https://telegram.org/apps) (or third party alternatives) installed on your phone/laptop, or just a browser to run [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org/).

## Why is important?

_Has it ever happened to you to have an idea that you would like to prototype faster?_ I know that is wrong to answer with a question to a question. But what we want is to allow you to implement some Machine Learning algorithm very fast, _on-the-fly_.

You won't need to go home, turn your computer on, open your IDE, copy some model from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), becoming mad installing packages till you give up your awesome idea and go back to your 9-5 job.

You just need to open your Telegram app and click the right buttons.

## This is a community based project.

No leaders here. Just passionate people desiring to learn, and _to create_. We organize **MeetUps** to make this real. If you are around Genova (Italy), come and build with us. 

### Where?
<a href="https://digitaltree.ai"><img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://github.com/deepgramtech/deepgramtech.github.io/blob/master/img/dtblack.png?raw=true">

At **[Digital Tree](https://digitaltree.ai), Viale Cembrano, 2, 16147 Genova GE.**




### When?

 Every two weeks, on Wednesday, **from 18 to 20**. 

## Outline

The meetups are structured as little hackatons of two hours, where specific (but not really fixed) goals have to be achieved. 

Our goal is mostly _learning by doing_, so we won't focus strictly on the advancement of the project at each meeting, but on learning as much as we can. The following is a outline of the content of the next three meetups:


### Meetup #1
```markdown

We will:

- Make a Telegram bot that takes an input on Telegram, make a simple operation outside, return the output on Telegram

- Find a server to host the bot

```
### Meetup #2
```markdown

We will:

- Make the bot to use a pretrained simple Neural Network to Classify Dog and Cats

- Make a DeepDream Telegram Version (input an image -> return a DeepDreamed image)

```

### Meetup #3
```markdown

We will: 

- Make a Telegram Channel with Datasets that can be used. First example: MNIST.
 
- Make the program to train a classifier on MNIST.

- Make the program to train an autoencoder on MNIST.

```





### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/deepgramtech/deepgramtech.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
